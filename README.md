 Blog Website

This program allows users to post blog posts onto a blog site. The new blogs will persist
as long as the user keeps the session running. The theme of the blogs is animal food recipes.
There are three different pages. The first page, index, displays all posts and is where the user
should start. Next there is the post page, where you can create posts with a title, category, and
content. Then there's the postview page, which displays details about a post and allows the user
to delete it.
